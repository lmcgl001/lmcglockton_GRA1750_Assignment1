<p><!--Warm Mineral Springs-->
	<a>Lieut. Col. William Royal, underwater explorer and author, while diving in Warm Mineral Springs in 1958 discovered stalactites and stalagmites well below the water line which provided evidence this spring was a dry cave over a very long period of years, possibly during the last ice age. Other dives resulted in the finding of ancient human skulls, bones and animal remains which gave indications of the presence of human and animal life in this part of Florida long before the beginning of written history. In 1977 the national significance of Warm Water Mineral Springs was recognized when it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places</a>

<p><!--Lithia Springs Regional Park-->
	<a>The parkâ€™s major attraction is the natural spring that provides an excellent swimming experience since the water temperature remains at 72 degrees Farenheit year-round. In addition to swimming, there is a bath house, playground and picnic facilities. Lithia Springs is also a popular camping spot with 44 sites and two shower houses. The campground office always closes one hour earlier than the remainder of the park. Those wishing to camp should arrive early.</a>

<p><!--Wakulla Springs-->
	<a>Wakulla Spring is one of the largest springs in the world, discharging an average of 260 million gallons of water per day. The spring pool is an impressive 315 feet in diameter, and the huge vent is estimated to be 82 feet wide and 50 feet high, and about 185 feet deep beneath a limestone ledge. In 2008 Tropical Storm Fay produced a record spring flow of almost 1.5 billion gallons per day! The vent extends into a massive network of caves that measures 28.6 miles to date, and is the fourth longest explored aquatic cave system in the world.</a>

<p><!--Silver Springs-->
	<a>Silver Springs is possibly most famous for its glass-bottom boat rides, from which the numerous springs and associated aquatic life may be viewed. Wildlife include alligators and turtles, catfish and mullet, and birds such as cormorants, great blue herons, great egrets, ibis, and limpkin. Rhesus monkeys that were first introduced in the 1930s have also established a population in the park. Over the years, Silver Springs has been the site of many Hollywood films, including a number of Tarzan films as well as the Sea Hunt television series.</a>

	<a>Blue Spring is the largest spring on the St. Johns River and discharges a historical average of 165 million gallons per day. The spring pool is circular, with a notable boil in the center and steep sandy banks that rise approximately 15 to 20 feet above water level. The spring run flows about 1,050 feet to the St. Johns River through a dense hardwood and palm forest, with picturesque live oak trees leaning over the run.</a>
